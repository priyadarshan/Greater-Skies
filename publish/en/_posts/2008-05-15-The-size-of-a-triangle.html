<p>What does size mean when you are talking about a triangle?  It
can be how much paint you need to color it, or how many kilos
of seed you need to plant on it to cover it with grass, or how
many rectangular cookies you can fit on it.  All these measures
are quite arbitrary, but they can all make sense on certain
occasions. <a href="/art/math/size-triangle/st-en.html">The article</a>.
