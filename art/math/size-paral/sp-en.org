* What is the size of a parallelogram?
  Not all solutions of a problem are created equal.  There are
  many ways to show how the size of a parallelogram can be found:
  one solution is very simple, but not general enough; some are
  general but complex, and some are general, simple and
  beautiful.  
*** The simple case
    When looking for a clear geometrical approach to find the
    area of a parallelogram I first thought about the simplest
    case, one like this:

#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
    [[file:img/paral-1.png]]

    The solution is rather easy, once you think about how it
    compares with the rectangle of base $b$ and height $h$:

#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
    [[file:img/paral-2.png]]

    You can remove the green triangle on the right and put it on
    the left, building a rectangle of height $h$ and width $b$
    that has exactly the same area as the original parallelogram:
    and we know [[file:six-times-nine.org][how to compute]] the area of a rectangle, $h\times b$.

#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
    [[file:img/paral-3.png]]

    This is an interesting result: it tells you that you can
    stretch your parallelogram as much as you want and, as long
    as you keep $b$ and $h$ constant it will have the same area.

    As much as we want?  Well, we don't actually know that.  It
    turns out that, as you stretch, you reach a point where the
    argument above does not hold anymore.  What would you say
    about this parallelogram?

#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
    [[file:img/paral-4.png]]

    It has the same $h$ and $b$ as the previous one, and maybe
    its area is the same, but we haven't showed it yet: the
    argument above does not apply to it, as we cannot cut the
    triangle on the right an put it on the left to build the
    rectangle.  It just doesn't fit:

#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
    [[file:img/paral-5.png]]

    You could of course rotate it, lay it on the long side, and
    you are in the first case.  But at this point the goal is not
    only to know its area: it is to show that it should be
    $h\times b$.  So we needed another argument, and an argument
    I found.  But, as it turns out, it was clear but long, not
    very pretty and therefore not satisfying.
*** The very slanted parallelogram
    Talking about it over lunch with some friends a couple of
    better solutions appeared.  Jaime Fernández and Ján Morovič
    quickly came up with a smart way to convert the new problem
    to the previous one, and then Utpal Sarkar, aka Doetoe,
    thought of a simple and very elegant solution.

    I encourage you to think about it yourself before looking at
    the solutions, and then read them in order: first the long
    one, then the smart one, then the elegant (and best) one.
***** The long and winding road
      The hypothesis is that it should be possible to fit this
      parallelogram into the $b$ times $h$ rectangle, so the area
      of the parallelogram should be $b\times h$.  One way to go
      about it is to stretch the rectangle so that it fills the
      gap:
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-6.png]]

      Now it's clear that the blue triangle on the right is
      exactly the same size of the dark green triangle, so we can
      move it to form a small rectangle:
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-7.png]]

      We have still the light green rectangle to cover, and the
      blue area to be fit.  If the hypothesis was right, and the
      area of the original parallelogram was the same as the area
      of the $b\times h$ rectangle, the blue area should fit
      exactly in the light green rectangle. One way to see if
      this is true is to consider these two triangles:
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-8.png]]

      They are identical.  Each of them contains one of the areas
      we want to show that are equal, plus an identical medium
      triangle (dark green), and an identical small triangle
      (gray):
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-9.png]]

      So the light green and the blue areas must be equal, and we
      have been able to fit exactly all the blue into the green.
***** Jaime and Ján's solution
      It is smarter and much simpler.  Take again the original
      parallelogram
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-jaime-1.png]]

      and cut it like this
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-jaime-2.png]]

      We can move the green triangle to the left, like this
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-jaime-3.png]]

      We have just constructed one parallelogram that has the
      exact same area as the original one, but is less slanted.
      In fact, it is [[*The%20simple%20case][a simple parallelogram]] for which we already
      know how to calculate the area.  

      If the original slant had been bigger we would have
      required more than one such transformation to reach the
      simple case; but we'll always reach it, so we can always
      reduce the problem to another that we know how to solve.
      And the solution for this simplest case is $b\times h$, so
      we know that the slanted parallelogram is also $b\times h$.
***** Doetoe's solution
      Doetoe was able to come up with an even simpler and more
      elegant solution by looking, literally, out of the box.
      Take the original slanted parallelogram 
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-doetoe-1.png]]

      and draw a box around it:
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-doetoe-2.png]]

      Now just slide the lower right triangle until it finds its
      match with the other one:
#+ATTR_HTML: class="clean-center"
      [[file:img/paral-doetoe-3.png]]

      There you have it, so general and beautiful and simple.
