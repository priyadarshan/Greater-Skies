<h2 id="sec-1">Why is six times nine the same as nine times six? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>When I asked my older son this question his immediate reply was
"Well, because multiplication is commutative".  Which is as
good as saying "because that's what it is, why won't you stop
asking obvious questions?".  He's been aware for a while of how
convenient this property of multiplications is: I would ask him
"how much is a thousand times three?", and instead of adding
three, plus three, plus three a thousand times he would say
"the same as three times a thousand, three thousand".
</p>
<p>
One way to see why these tricks are possible is to draw a
graphic representation of the multiplication.  Six times nine
means taking a group of nine things and replicating them six
times, like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/6-times-9.png" class="clean-center" alt="img/6-times-9.png" />
</p>
<p>
And nine times six means taking a group of six and stacking
them up nine times, like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="img/9-times-6.png" class="clean-center" alt="img/9-times-6.png" />
</p>
<p>
If we only care about how many elements are there, all we are
doing is rotating the rectangle: and a nice property of
rectangles is that their size does not change when we rotate
them.
</p>
<p>
Another good opportunity for a shortcut is the answer to "how
many groups of 24 minutes are there in a day?".  The total
number of minutes in a day is: 24 hours in a day times 60
minutes in an hour.  But regardless of which number this
product turns out to be (1440), it is 24 times 60, which is the
same as 60 times 24: so 24 periods of 60 minutes is the same as
60 periods of 24 minutes.  And if a day has 60 groups of 24
minutes, it also has 120 groups of 12 minutes, which has
nothing to do with the original question but is a beautiful
thing.
