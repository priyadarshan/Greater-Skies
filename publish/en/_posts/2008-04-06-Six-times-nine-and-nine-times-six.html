<p>When I asked my older son this question his immediate reply was
"Well, because multiplication is commutative".  Which is as
good as saying "because that's what it is, why won't you stop
asking obvious questions?".  He's been aware for a while of how
convenient this property of multiplications is: I would ask him
"how much is a thousand times three?", and instead of adding
three, plus three, plus three a thousand times he would say
"the same as three times a thousand, three
thousand". <a href="/art/math/six-times-nine/stn-en.html">The article</a>.
