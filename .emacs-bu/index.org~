* About Greater Skies
  Greater Skies started as an online repository of things I
  wanted to explain to my children. I want them to find the
  fascination of the sudden comprehension, and I also want them
  to have a sense of where they are: how big things are, how do
  they work, how do they interrelate, where does this earth they
  live on belong.

  I was not only talking to them now, at their 9 and 11 years: I
  wanted to explain everything I would like to tell them about,
  regardless of how complex it is, so that they will understand
  it when the time comes. Trying to be clear, but without dumbing
  things down. This is not child talk.

  I learnt many of these things in needlessly complicated or
  boring ways.  This is unfortunate.  We need to make an effort
  to find the clearest explanations, those that are most likely
  to light the flash of insight.  Learning is not easy: we should
  not hide the fact that it requires effort and perseverance, nor
  should we make it any more difficult than it is. 

  There are more articles [[/es/][in Spanish]] than in English.  Eventualy
  everything will be in at least these two languages.

  I want Greater Skies to grow into a collaborative project.  It
  is hosted at [[http://github.com/juanre/Greater-Skies][github]], and I've set it up so that it should be
  easy to add articles and translations (if you are familiar with
  =git=, emacs and [[http://orgmode.org][Orgmode]]).  So far only English and Spanish are
  represented, but I'd like to add other languages.  If you want
  to contribute you can do it in two ways: write things down and
  [[http://juanreyero.com/][send them]] to me, or fork the =git= repository at github, add
  whatever you deem convenient, and let me know.
