<h2 id="sec-1">About Greater Skies </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Greater Skies started as an on-line repository of things I
wanted to explain to my children. I want them to find the
fascination of the sudden comprehension, and I also want them
to have a sense of where they are: how big things are, how do
they work, how do they interrelate, where does this earth they
live on belong.
</p>
<p>
I was not only talking to them now, at their 9 and 11 years: I
wanted to explain everything I would like to tell them about,
regardless of how complex it is, so that they will understand
it when the time comes. Trying to be clear, but without dumbing
things down. This is not child talk.
</p>
<p>
I learnt many of these things in needlessly complicated or
boring ways.  This is unfortunate.  We need to make an effort
to find the clearest explanations, those that are most likely
to light the flash of insight.  Learning is not easy: we should
not hide the fact that it requires effort and perseverance, nor
should we make it any more difficult than it is. 
</p>
<p>
There are more articles <a href="/es/">in Spanish</a> than in English.  Eventually
everything will be in at least these two languages.
</p>
<p>
I want Greater Skies to grow into a collaborative project.  It
is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/juanre/Greater-Skies">github</a>, and I've set it up so that it should be
easy to add articles and translations (if you are familiar with
<code>git</code>, emacs and <a href="http://orgmode.org">Orgmode</a>).  So far only English and Spanish are
represented, but I'd like to add other languages.  If you want
to contribute you can do it in two ways: write things down and
<a href="http://juanreyero.com/">send them</a> to me, or fork the <code>git</code> repository at github, add
whatever you deem convenient, and let me know.
